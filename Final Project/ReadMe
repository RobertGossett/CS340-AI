This file explains the funcitonalities of the final project are described here below. 

This project was created by Robert Gossett, Richard Poutier and Khayyam Zubair for the final project of the AI class. 

What is working:
In the GameManager.h file, there is a function called start_game() which runs the entire game. It asks which player type to play the game with. 

When the player chooses one, the GameManager plays out the game in the sequence suitable for a human player. 

When the player chooses 0, the AI plays the game. 

On line 279 of the GameManager.h file, the AI functions are contained. 

The AI doesn't actually work, but if it did, it would 
1. build the waitlist
2. get the bestmove 
3. make the move, and repeat until the board is filled.
